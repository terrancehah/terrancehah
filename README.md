# Hi, I'm Terrance! 👋

I'm a tuition tutor and self-taught programmer with a degree in International Business. Driven by curiosity, I explore all sorts of possibilities in tech, building projects that spark my interest—from AI-driven tools to mobile apps.

## About Me
As a self-taught programmer, I’ve developed web and mobile apps that integrate AI, modern frameworks, and user-centric features to solve real-world problems. I’m eager to explore new tech possibilities, like creating an AI-driven travel planner and a viral restaurant discount platform with referral systems. I also create personal tools like bilingual quote apps and personal portfolio site, exploring how tech can enhance productivity and creativity.
